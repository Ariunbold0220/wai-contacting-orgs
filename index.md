Overview {#overview}
--------------------
{:.no_toc}

You will find steps on how to report accessibility problems to websites
on this page:

1.  **Identify key contacts**
2.  **Describe the problem**
3.  **Follow-up as needed**

Additional tips include:

-   Consider what approach will get the results you want
-   Keep records of all communications for possible follow-up
-   Encourage others to also provide feedback to the organization
-   Use the sample emails provided below

## Introduction {#intro}
{:.no_toc}

This document shows you how to encourage organizations to make their
website accessible. Contact organizations when you find accessibility
barriers on their website.

Your feedback to an organisation can help them improve their website's
accessibility. This will benefit you, other people who use the website,
as well as the organization itself.

Some website owners are not aware of the importance of making websites
accessible. They also often have competing priorities for change and
improvements. Organizations will likely increase the priority of
accessibility if they hear about it. This is particularly true if the
feedback comes from people who use their website.

## Who do You Email? {#contact}

Identify the person responsible for the web page or application that is
inaccessible. You could also look for the person responsible for
accessibility at the organization. Be aware that there often is not a
dedicated accessibility employee. Sometimes you will have to use any
contact you can find. Look for links on their website such as:

-   Accessibility
-   Editor, Author, Page Owner, Webmaster
-   Contact Us, Feedback, Comments
-   Help, Support, Customer Service, FAQ

Some links will be email addresses. Other links go to online forms, or
provide other ways to contact the organization.

You could look in other places if you cannot find contact details on the
website, such as:

-   Telephone directory
-   Local library and librarian
-   Local business directory
-   Public companies register

## What to Include in Your Email {#report}

Provide a clear description of the accessibility barrier. This will help
the organization find and fix the problem. A clear description includes
information such as:

-   The page where you found a problem
-   What the problem is
-   What computer and software you use
-   A screenshot of the page

### Where is the Problem? {#where}

Include the web address (also called URL), or a description of the page.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

Example of a web address (URL):

-   http://www.example.org/services/local.html
-   https://www.example.org/checkout/confirm.php

Examples of page descriptions:

-   "The Local Services page, the one with the lists of Residential and
    Business Services"
-   "The Confirm Sale page after I entered my credit card information"
-   "The Search Results from the Services Directory Database"

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

### What the Problem is {#prob}

Provide details about what you were trying to do, and why it was
difficult or impossible to do it.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

Examples of problem descriptions:

-   **Keyboard navigation** - I can't get from the home page to the
    pages for paying my bill. I can't use a mouse so I use Tab to get to
    links, but I can't tab to the Pay Your Bills link.
-   **Mouse clicking** - It's hard for me to get the mouse to stop on
    small things. In the survey, it’s hard to click the little circles.
    On other surveys I've used, I can click on the words as well as the
    circles, which is a lot easier.
-   **Small text** - I can't read the bus timetables because the text is
    too small. I set the text size to Larger in my browser, but the text
    didn't get any bigger.
-   **Overlapping text** - I had trouble reading the small text. The
    text overlapped other text and pictures when I increased the text
    size in my browser. This made it impossible to read the page.
-   **Color combinations** - The colors make it hard to see the text.
    This makes it hard to read some of the product descriptions. I have
    problems with blue/yellow and blue/orange color combinations.
-   **Alt text** - I'm using a screen reader to listen to your website.
    Screen readers can’t read images; they read the alt text from the
    code. The images on this page are missing alt text. For example, I
    hear "240.gif" which my friend tells me is an image for Special
    Discounts.
-   **Distracting animations** - I found the home page very confusing.
    It was difficult to find the information I wanted with all the
    animated things all over the page. They kept drawing my attention
    away from what I was trying to read.
-   **Captions** - There are good video tutorials on your website. But I
    cannot get much information from these videos because I can't hear
    them. The videos are missing captions.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

### What Computer and Software are You Using? {#about}

Provide details about your computer and software. If you don't know,
maybe a friend, a relative, or a colleague can help you find that
information. You can skip this part, but it will often help the
organization find and fix the problem more easily.

Include:

-   The **operating system** you are using, and the version
-   The **browser** you use to view the Web, and the version

Also include the following information if it relates to the problem you
are having:

-   Any **settings** you have customized
-   Any **assistive technology** that you use

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

Examples of detailed computer and software descriptions:

-   I use Windows 10 with Internet Explorer 11 and Tazti voice
    recognition software. This allows me to navigate my computer screen
    and the Web.
-   I use the NVDA screen reader version 2017.2 with Windows 10 Home
    edition and the Firefox browser version 60.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

Include all the information you know, even if you don't know all the
information.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

Examples of simple descriptions:

-   I use a Mac with the Safari browser and set the Universal Access to
    never use fonts smaller than 14.
-   I use Windows with Edge. I changed the Windows colors to give me
    yellow text on a black background as it’s easier to read.
-   I use the Opera browser with Windows and I use keystrokes to
    navigate websites (I can't use a mouse at all).

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

*Note:* **Do not reveal personal information such as passwords, via
email or otherwise.** Do not provide any information that you are not
comfortable disclosing.

### Screenshot of the Page {#screenshot}

An image is worth a thousand words. In some cases, providing a
screenshot will help the organization identify the problem. This makes
it easier for them to fix it.

### Request Reply {#requestreply}

Ask the organization to reply to you. Give them a timeframe for their
response. Include how you want them to contact you.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="Example" class="example" %}
{:/}

-   Please contact me by email within 2 weeks.
-   I would appreciate a phone call in the next few days.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}
{:/}

Include a phone number in case they want to discuss the problem, if you
are comfortable with talking to them.

Provide Sources for More Information {#pointers}
-------------------------------------------------

Help the organization understand these web accessibility issues.
Consider including the following resources:

-   **[Accessibility - W3C](http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)<br>
    http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility.html**
-   [Introduction to Web Accessibility](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php)<br>
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php
-   [Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization](http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview.html)<br>

    Web](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web)<br>

-   [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php)<br>
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php

Follow-Up {#follow-up}
-----------------------

Responsible organizations will follow up with you. But sometimes you
might need to follow up with them.

### Be Available for Follow-up {#follow}

The website developers might need more information to diagnose and fix
the problem. Make yourself available to help them and provide that
information.

### Keep Records for Further Follow-Up {#records}

You might need records if you later decide to [take further
action](#action). In particular:

-   Keep copies of the website when you first encounter the problem.
    Make other copies any time the website changes. For example, take
    screenshots, save the pages on your hard drive, or print the pages.
-   Keep copies of all correspondence, including email, postal mail or
    online forms. Keep this in either print or electronic formats.
-   Keep records of all phone calls. Include the dates, the name of the
    person you talked with as well as what you discussed.

### Getting a Response {#response}

You may get a quick response, or it may take longer to hear back. It
depends on the company's culture, policies, and internal systems.

The reply may be a simple acknowledgement that the organization received
your feedback. This may be generated automatically, especially if you
use an online feedback form. The organization should follow up later
with a direct reply to your issue.

Sometimes the organization does not have expertise in accessibility. As
a result, they may not understand your feedback. They may assume the
issue is on your end, with your browser or assistive technology.

Note that in some cases, the organization might fix the problem and not
notify you.

Take further action if you do not receive a satisfactory response in a
reasonable time.

### Further Action to Consider {#action}

IYou may take further action if you feel the organization is not
resolving the problem. The following are some ideas to consider:

-   Contact an advocacy group of people with disabilities to see if they
    will get involved. You could also contact an advocacy group of older
    people, or other advocacy group.
-   Contact the organization's senior management. Sometimes going to the
    CEO or the Managing Director makes a difference.
-   Use online community resources to tell others about the inaccessible
    website. Share what the organisation did in response to your
    contact.
-   Contact the press or write a "letter to the editor".
-   Start a petition (maybe online).
-   Contact your local government representative if the website is for a
    government organization.
-   Lodge a formal complain with the relevant industry regulator or
    ombudsman.
-   Contact the government department responsible for disability rights
    or older people's rights. Or contact the human rights commission, or
    your local equivalent.
-   Consider legal action. For example, based on web accessibility
    requirements in [anti-discrimination regulations in your
    country](/WAI/Policy/).

Consider Your Approach {#approach}
-----------------------------------

Consider what approach will get the results you want. Your tone in
emails, phone calls, and other communications influences how people
react. Their response will depend on how they felt when they received
your communication. "You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar".
In other words, a polite and concise approach is more likely to get a
positive response.

Assume an organization doesn't know about the accessibility barriers on
their website. You can adjust your approach if their response shows they
are unwilling to fix the barriers. Their response will guide your choice
of follow-up action.

### Asking Others to Help {#ask}

Feel free to ask someone for help. You may need help with understanding
the problem you are experiencing on the website. You may want assistance
in communicating with the organization. An advocacy group may contact
the organization on your, or their own, behalf

### Encouraging Accessible Websites {#encourage}

Complain when there are barriers. Provide praise when there are no, or
few, barriers. Providing positive feedback is important when
organizations do a good job with accessibility. Positive feedback
motivates individuals. It also encourages organizations to invest in web
accessibility.

### Sample Email 1 {#email1}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="<strong>Subject:</strong> Problem with Citylights' ticket page" %}
{:/}

Dear Citylights Marketing Manager,

I have encountered some accessibility barriers on your website.

I recently visited your ticket offers page
(http://www.cl.example.com/tickets/mank.html) looking for tickets for
Thelonius Mank. I couldn't use the page because the gray text on the
black background is too hard to read.

You can get information about web accessibility from the web page <br>
http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility.html

As I am a CityLights' events fan, I would appreciate your attention to
this problem - please let me know when it's fixed. If you would like me
to supply any further information, please email me.

Regards, Maria

### Sample Email 2 {#email2}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="<strong>Subject:</strong> Accessibility of Citylights' news page" %}
{:/}

Hello Citylights Director,

Your news page (http://www.cl.example.com/news/news.html) is not
accessible. I listen to web pages with the NVDA screen reader (version
2017.2). I use Windows 10 and Internet Explorer 11.

My colleague told me that you had some heat wave information so I went
to the news page, however there was something strange going on. I found
a sentence about the heat wave and temperatures, but then there was
something about the violin case man. Much of the page seemed mixed up
and was confusing for me to listen to - it appears it was not written in
a linear fashion so that someone like me using a screen reader can
understand it.

Also, your news page doesn't have any headings. Headings are important
because I use them to get an overview of the page and to help me
navigate to the stories.

Please check out this web accessibility information from the W3C:

-   Accessibility - W3C <br>

### Sample Email 3 {#email3}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="start" title="<strong>Subject:</strong> Problem accessing Citylights' surveys" %}
{:/}

Hi Citylights,

Love your stories, but not your surveys! I can't use a mouse very much
because my arms don’t work well. Usually I tab around web pages. Anyway,
on your survey page I was only able to get to the question about how
many cars we have when I tabbed around. When I did try using the mouse
to answer the 'where do I live' question, I couldn't click on the words
like I can on many other sites' forms, I had to click the little circle
before the words.

In case it helps you diagnose and fix the problem: I have a Win10 laptop
and use Chrome browser Version 60.0.3112.78.

To learn more about these and other accessibility issues, check out
www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility.html

By the way, making your site accessible will benefit Citylights too, see
Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization
(www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview.html).

Please tell me when you've fixed these problems. Happy to help you
further. You can ring me at 12-345-6789.

Best,
Jasmine
